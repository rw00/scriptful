# > fb m2www.txt

## Use Case
Ever copied a FaceBook link from your mobile phone to your Desktop PC and got an ugly web page that is rendered specifically for phones?
Well, that is because it is on the domain m.facebook.com
This JavaScript script will turn the `m.` to a `www.` but that alone wouldn't fix the issue. The resource path structure will need to be adjusted as well.

## Installation
Simply open your fave browser and create a new bookmark with the name `fbm2www`, with the URL as the content of the file `fb m2www.txt`

## Usage
Copy the Facebook link from your phone to your Desktop browser and open it.
Then, just click on the bookmark created above and BAM!
